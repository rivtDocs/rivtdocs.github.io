[s] Brace design
    For this example the fourth floor brace will be designed. From the analysis,
    the earthquake force, rhoP_E, on the brace is known.

    [t] dl compression                      | PD = 8000*KIPS
    [t] ll compression                      | PL = 6*KIPS
    [t] eq tension                          | Q_PEt = -328*KIPS
    [t] eq compression                      | Q_PEc = 328*KIPS
    [t] non-assembly,-parking < 100 psf     | f1 = 0.5
    [t] redundancy factor                   | rho = 1.0
    [t] pi                                  | pi = 3.14

    [e] max compression 1.2 D + 1.0 E + 0.5L (Eq 16-5) #- 13
        P_dc = 1.48*PD + PL*f1 + rho*Q_PEc

    [e] max tension 0.9 D + 1.0 (Eq 6-7)  #- 13
        P_dt = 0.62*PD + rho*Q_PEt/f1

[s] Brace compression strength
    The distance from work-point to work-point is 17.9 feet. The ductile
    detailing requirements for SCBF result in the provision of a hinge zone
    in the connection; it is assumed here that the hinge zone will be at least
    9 inches from the work point at each end, resulting in a reduction of the brace
    length of 18 inches. The brace length = 197 inches. HSS 9.625x0.500 will be
    used. Section properties are from the 13th Edition LRFD Manual.

    [t] boundary condition coefficient  | K_1 = 1.0
    [t] unbraced lenght                 | l_1 = 197*IN
    [t] radius of gyration              | r_1 = 3.24*IN
    [t] elastic modulus                 | E_1 = 29000*KSI
    [t] yield stress                    | F_y = 42*KSI
    [t] cross section area              | A_g = 13.4*IN**2
    [t] HSS section depth               | D_e = 9.625*IN
    [t] HSS section thickness           | t_e = 0.500*IN

    [e] Slenderness ratio #- 03
        Kl_r = K_1 * l_1 / r_1

    [e] Buckling stress #- 43
        F_e = pi**2 * E_1 / (K_1*l_1/r_1)**2

    [e] Critical buckling stress (AISC 360, E3-2) #- 43
        F_cr = F_y * 0.658**(F_y/F_e)

    [e] Compression strength (AISC 360 E3-1) #- 13
        phiP_c = 0.9 * A_g *F_cr

    [c] Check brace slenderness limit (AISC 341-13.2a) | ok | 2
        K_1 * l_1/r_1  | <= | 4 * sqrt(E_1/F_y)

    Note that under the exception, braces with Kl/r < 200 are allowed if capacity
    design is used for columns

    [c] Check brace width-to-thickness (AISC 341-13.2d, T 1.8.1) | ok | 2
        D_e  / t_e | <= | 0.44*E_1 / F_y

[s] Brace tension strength

    [e] Design tension strength (AISC 360, D1-1) #- 13
        phiP_t = 0.9 * F_y * A_g

    [t] tension demand on brace | P_u = 350*KIPS

    [c] Check tension strength | ok | 2
        P_u / phiP_t | <= | 1.0

    Equation D1-2, which applies to fracture of the net section, is checked in the design
    of the connection.

[s] Distribution of force between braces
    AISC 341-13.2c does not permit a major unbalance between braces working in
    compression and those working in tension to resist lateral loads. The frames in this
    structure are symmetrical and no single-diagonal frames are used. An elastic analysis
    shows that the seismic force resisted by compression is identical to that resisted by
    tension and the frame complies with the requirement. The tension strength of
    braces is similar in each direction, so that even after degradation of
    the compression strength of braces there is no significant tendency to accumulate
    drift in one direction.
