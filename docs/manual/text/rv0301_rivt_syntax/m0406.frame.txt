[s] Frame analysis
    Small eccentricities occur at the connections to facilitate detailing.
    These eccentricities result in flexural forces in the framing
    members, as well as larger drifts than those for frames without eccentricities. It is
    therefore necessary to include the eccentricities in the frame model.
    Using the frame forces from Table 1 A4, the frame shown in Figure 1A-5 is analyzed.
    Columns are modeled as fixed at the base and braces as pinned at each end. Although
    in-plane rotation of the gusseted beam-to-column connection may induce some
    flexural forces in the brace, these are small at the elastic drift level. Beams are
    modeled as having fixed connections at their gusseted connections to the columns;
    these details include beam-to-column joint flange welds. (AISC 341, 7.2)

[s] Story drifts
    In this design example a second-order analysis has been
    performed, and the B2 amplification factor is not required.
    The displacements from the model are converted to design story drifts and compared
    to the allowable drift from ASCE/SEI 7-05 Table 12.2-1. The story drifts are
    calculated from the displacements, and divided by the reliability/redundancy factor,
    rho and I. The drifts from the elastic analysis are multiplied by the displacement
    amplification factor, Cd. The design story drift for each level of this frame is less
    than the allowable drift. Because the building design is symmetrical and
    has rigid diaphragms, the average story drift will not exceed the drift of this frame.
    Thus, the building will meet the drift limitations of Table 12.12-1.
