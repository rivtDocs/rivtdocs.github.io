ign Basis and Performance Criteria                                [0201][1]
============================================================================
 
  The AST design basis includes both analysis and tests. Because the structural
  system and loads are relatively small the complete system can be readily
  tested at design and failure loads to directly determine demand capacity
  ratios and structural reliability. Procedures for design and testing are taken
  from UL2703, IEC 61251, NBCI Part 6, IS 801, AISI S100, IS 456 and ACI 318. A
  list of design standards are provided in Section 7. 
 
  Component design loads are calculated using RISA 3D and Algor structural
  models that include the AST material properties, geometry and
  boundary conditions. Load demands are checked against design capacities
  determined from the above industry standards. Cracking, deflection, yielding
  and buckling test results are then correlated with the predicted behavior from
  the models.
 
  The design wind loads are described and calculated in section [0202]. The
  design wind velocity pressure is calculated from NIBC Part 4 chapter 6 - 3
  second gusts. Aerodynamic pressure coefficients are based on wind tunnel
  studies conducted for Alion by RWDI (see section 7 for references). The
  coefficients also include dynamic effects. The wind tunnel results include
  normal force and moment gust coefficients for each half table (3 modules),
  table, half row and row.
 
  Seismic design loads are determined using NIBC Part 4 Chapter 6. In its seismic
  response the AST is a simple SDOF system and the seismic load is the design
  base shear. Seismic loads are calculated in section [0202]. 
 
  The NBCI governing load combinations are:
 
  |  DL + WL
  |  DL + EL
  | 
  | where:
  |  DL = Dead Load
  |  WL = Wind Load
  |  EL = Earthquake Load  
 
 
  **Structural Performance**
 
  Design strength of the slip-formed plain concrete tracks are
  determined using NBCI and ACI 318 design methods for structural plain
  concrete as described in report section 3. Each track section is expected to
  remain uncracked under shear, axial and bending moments generated by
  shrinkage, settlement, thermal, dead, wind and seismic loads. 
 
  Tables are expected to remain operational and essentially elastic
  after the design wind (~300 year MRI)and seismic events (~1000 year MRI).
  Member capacities for the table components are determined using AISI
  S100 design and testing procedures and their design is described in
  Division 4.
 
  Torsional instablities at a range of wind speeds have been studied by RWDI.
  Their results provide limits stiffness and damping limits that, when met,
  suppress the instabilities. Calculations and tests show that the AST stiffness
  and damping are high enough to suppress resonance and instability.
 
  At higher wind speeds the system is stowed at 0 degrees and
  the panel is locked against rotation by a normal force reaction of the locking
  plate against the drive tube. Because the drive tube does not twist, galloping
  is not possible. Damping is further discussed in Section 5.
 
  The high lateral frequency of the tables in the wind normal direction reduces
  resonant wind response. The high stiffness is a result of the A-frame design
  and the high torsional stiffness (locked) and high equivalent viscous damping
  associated with the gear lock and drive bearing system. Therefore,
  equivalent static analysis, without amplification, is used for wind design.
  System frequency is further discussed in Section 6.
 
  Fatigue is typically not a design consideration for components with designs
  governed by extreme wind and seismic loads defined by building codes and
  standards. Loads that represent a significant proportion of the yield strength
  will only occur a few hundred times over the life time of the structure. IS
  801 does not directly address fatigue for CFS material The North American
  standard *AISI S100* provides the following
  guidance:
 
  ::
  `  
       Since the occurrence of full design wind or earthquake loads is
       too infrequent to warrant consideration in fatigue design, the
       evaluation of fatigue resistance shall not be required.
  `
 
  The threshold fatigue stress for non-welded material is 25 ksi. On the
  order of 100,000 cycles at stresses that exceed that threshold
  would be required for fatigue to govern. A major wind event (> 70 mph) is
  expected to have on the order of 100 fatigue-relevant cycles and
  those events will occur no more than a few times over the design life.
  Seismic cyclic frequency is another order of magnitude lower.
 
 
  **Summary of Component Tests**
 
  In addition to model analysis, tests were run on the following components and
  assemblies to verify models and determine capacities where modeling was
  complex. The procedures and results are described in the **04 Track**
  and **05 Table** calculation sections and Appendices.
 
  - Table tests:  A-frame assembly load tests on a shortened table.
  - Z-Purlin tests: Load tests on full scale Z-purlins
  - FEJ tests:  Tension and shear tests on the FEJ
  - Drive system tests: Single and multiple table dynamic and static tests

tic And Dynamic Wind Models                                       [0201][2]
============================================================================
 
  Design wind pressures are developed using NBCI wind velocity pressures
  together with normal force and moment gust coefficients :math:`GC_P`
  and :math: 'GC_M' provided by RWDI wind tunnel studies (see subsection 8). The
  analysis is a static, linear elastic analysis except for the contact springs
  at the track base which permit uplift.
 
  GC_P and GC_M are the sum of two coefficients; a static pressure coefficient
  that applies to all rigid components and an additive dynamic coefficient
  representing inertial loads as a function of the frequency and damping of a
  particular modal response. The AST has three primary, wind-driven modal
  responses; purlin bending, A-frame deflection and drive system rotation. These
  are discussed in subsequent subsections.
 
  The aerodynamic static and dynamic gust factors are provided at 0, 5, 10, 20,
  30, 45 and 60 degrees and for for exterior, edge and interior tables and half
  and quarter rows.  Design load case patterns at 0 (stow), 20 (maximum operation torque) 
and 60
  (maximum operation normal force) degrees, are provided below for the
  critical combinations of the component configurations.
 
  The structural design includes two track configurations, two
  table configurations and two drive configurations that are combined as
  follows:
 
  - **Exterior row** : Connected track with exterior tables (3 A-frames)
    and two slew drives   
  - **Transition row (2nd row)** : Connected track with table
    (2 A-frames) and two slew drives except edge table is an end table
  - **Interior row** : Track (separated) and table with one slew drive. 
 
  For this pilot project with two exterior row configurations, only exterior
  row calculations are provided. They are checked for the following
  combinations:
 
  - **Stow load**: Maximum up and down normal force and torque at 0 degree
    stow and V= 39 m/s     
  - **Operation torque**: Maximum operation torque at 20 degrees and V = 22 m/s
  - **Operation normal force**: Maximum up and down operation normal
    force at 60 degrees and V = 22 m/s
 
 
 
  The design wind pressure is calculated from NBCI Part 6 Section 4 and
  reference [4] using the following relations:
 
  :math:`V_z = V_b k_1 k_2 k_3 k_h`
 
  :math:`p_z = 0.6 V_z^2`
 
  :math:`p_d = K_d p_z`
 
  where:
 
  :math:`V_b` : basic 3 second gust at 10 m
 
  :math:`V_z` : AST design wind speed at 10 m
 
  :math:`k_1 = 0.92` : low hazard risk coefficient
 
  :math:`k_2 = 1.00` : terrain Category 2, structure Class A
 
  :math:`k_3 = 1.0` : topography
 
  :math:`k_h = 0.8` : height factor for structures under 10 m
 
  :math:`k_d = 0.9` : direction factor
 
  :math:`V_b` : basic 3 second gust at 10 m
 
  :math:`p_d` : design wind pressure in N/m^2 
 
 
  The net design forces are then:  
 
  :math:`F_N = p_d (GC_P_s \pm GC_P_d)  A`
 
  :math:`M_t_o_r = p_d (GC_M_s \pm GC_M_d) A \cdot L/2`
 
 
  where:
 
  :math:`A` : tributary surface area  
 
  :math:`L` is the panel chord length  
 
  :math:`F_N` is the normal force acting on the tributary area
 
  :math:`M_t_o_r` is the torque acting about the centerline of the module
 
  :math:`GC_p_s` : net static gust coefficients (RWDI wind tunnel report)
 
  :math:`GC_p_d` : net dynamic gust coefficients (RWDI wind tunnel report)
 
 
  In the reduction from gust coefficients to pressures and loads applied
  to the structural models, the maximum normal force and moments are assumed to
  occur at the same time. For structural analysis the force-moment pair is
  translated to half-chord uniform pressures. This results in a table pressure
  model with four patches. For this analysis a two patch (upper and lower half
  chord) load model is used, based on the larger of the half table loads. This
  is slightly conservative. 
 
  To better capture structural behavior and simplify analysis
  different structural models were developed to analyze 
  wind and seismic forces on structural components and to determine structural
  frequencies. The wind load and frequency models are shown below.

tic Cutoff Frequency                                              [0201][3]
============================================================================
 
 
  The RWDI wind report provided cutoff frequencies for above which inertial
  effects are not significant inthe design. Figure 3.1 shows the cutoff line
  which is velocity dependent. The blue line indicates the cutoff frequency for
  operation wind velocities and red line the cutoff for stow velocities.
  Inertial loads from dynamic effects do not need to be applied when the
  fundamental modal response is above the cutoff threshold. The three principal
  component driven modes are:
 
  - Z-purlin bending
  - Major axis A-frame bending and overturning
  - Drive system rotation - stow
  - Drive system rotation - operaion
 
 
 
  The RWDI procedure for calculating dynamic effects decouples the 
  mode response for the different components. Each component can be treated
  independently. Frequencies for the first few modes, which include the
  Z-purlin and A-frame and drive system in stow are provided in the table below.
  Drive system rotation under operation is analyzed in calculation section
  [0202][1]. The fundamental modes represent Z-purlin and frame minor axis
  bending.

  From the above analysis the addition of dynamic forces are only needed for
  the drive system, while in operation. The table below summarizes the
