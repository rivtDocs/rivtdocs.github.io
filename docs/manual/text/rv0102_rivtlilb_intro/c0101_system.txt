  This calculation report covers the structural design of the Alion StormTracker
  (AST) 66 kW pilot project located in the Kurnool District, Andhra Pradesh,
  India. The AST is a single axis tracker with :math:`\pm` 60 :math:`\degree`
  tilt designed to maximize power output while reducing installation and
  maintenance costs. Calculations are numbered and organized as **[rrcc][s]**,
  where **rr** is the report section, **cc** is the calculation number and **s**
  is the calculation section. The report is divided into four sections that
  provide a design overview, performance criteria, and track and table
  structural analysis and design calculations. Three appendices contain
  supporting project and product information, test descriptions and detailed
  computer output. Structural drawings listed on the cover sheet provide
  structural details, dimensions and field installation instructions. 
 
  The small pilot project includes 210, 2m x 1m dual glass modules arranged in a
  two row block. Blocks in full scale projects typically have dozens of rows.
  Because wind loads vary between exterior and interior rows the structural
  design varies for different parts of the block. The figure below shows the
  overall structural configuration. This project includes only exterior rows and
  does not include calculations for the interior row design. For a complete
  system calculation please refer to the separate document *AST Reference
  Structural Calculations - LRFD*.
 
 
 
 
 
  The structural design loads are based on geographically mapped loads and other
  building code parameters adopted by local authorities with project
  jurisdiction. For this project the National Building Code - India (NBC-I)
  is used. The wind and seismic maps from the NBC-I including project location
  are shown below. AST terms are defined below in Section 7. Design standards
  and calculation terms are listed in Report Section 02.

 Overview                                                         [0101][2]

  The AST is a single axis ballasted system with automated cleaning
  and maintenance capability integrated into the structural design (see Figures
  2.1 and 2.2). The three primary structural components are a slip formed
  concrete track (track), a CFS table that supports six modules (table), and a
  geared drive system that reduces torque demand by more than an order of
  magnitude (drive).
 
  The concrete ballast provides soil bearing, resists seismic and wind
  overturning and serves as a guide track for the maintenance vehicles. The CFS
  table is designed to minimize steel weight and integrate with the track and
  drive system. The drive system is designed to follow terrain using couplers
  that allow for angle changes between tables. AST features supporting the
  design goals of installation flexibility and simplicity, system longevity,
  and material reduction include:
 
  - The system is supported on long life, slip-formed concrete tracks. Soil
    bearing pressures are low and metal is not buried in soil.
  - Automated O&M vehicles operate on the tracks.
  - A tracker row is divided into six-module tables
    with drive line couplers between each table that accommodate
    uneven ground with minimal site preparation.      
  - Field assembled components, including A-frames, purlins, arc-gears and
    drive tubes are fabricated from cold formed pre-galvanized
    sheet that weigh less than 30 pounds each. Total steel weight in a table is
    approximately 120 lbs, or 1 psf of module area.
  - The drive tube is geared to reduce transmission torques and reduce the size
    of the drive tube.      
  - Panels are mechanically locked at 0 :math:`\degree` stow to minimize wind
    forces and eliminate system torsional instability and divergence.
    Locking occurs through a Geneva drive mechanism that provides a rotation
    dwell when the table is flat. In this position a semi-circular locking plate
    resists module rotation through a radial contact force with the drive tube.
    The drive tube does not rotate in the stow position.
  - PV panels may be framed or dual glass.
 
  Terms for the assemblies and components are defined as follows:

  **Tracks:** Tracks are separated pairs of structural plain concrete grade beams
  that provide bearing capacity, over-turning ballast and guides for the
  maintenance vehicles. They are slip-formed as continuous strips with control
  joints (CJ) cut between table legs to control the location of shrinkage cracks.
  There are two CJ per table and the maximum spacing between control joints is
  about 10 feet. Project plans provide specific dimensions. They include a slip
  formed groove on the top surface for anchoring the A-frame feet. The CJ pair
  for the last A-frame in a row is referred to as a locking control joint and is
  angled to engage adjacent concrete in area-averaged uplift in these more wind
  intensive regions. The AST uses two types of cross section profiles; tracks
  and exterior tracks.
 
  **Exterior Tracks:** Exterior tracks are used for the outside rows
  of a block and the second row in, referred to as exterior and transition rows
  respectively. They are similar to tracks with the followings differences:
 
  - The cross section profile is a single, stiffened strip that provides
    additional ballast.
  - Where three A-frames per table are used, three control joints per table
    between each of the three A-frames are cut.
 
  **Slew Drive Base:** The slew drive base is a cast-in-place concrete ballast
  block under each slew drive (see section [3]).
 
  **A-Frame:** A-frames are standardized, factory assembled, stamped or rolled
  pre-galvanized 18 gauge sections. Additional structural capacity can be added
  to a project design by increasing the number of A-frames per table. Standard
  designs include two A-frames per table for interior and transition rows, and
  three A-frames at exterior rows. A-frame components include feet, stiffened
  C-channel legs and C-channel ties. Connections are made with standard torqued
  or proprietary lock bolts with sufficient tension to prevent slip in the
  joints. A-frame feet are anchored in the track groove with structural epoxy. 
 
  **Arc assembly:** Arc-gears are riveted, semi-circular factory assembled
  racks made from stamped 16 gauge pre-galvanized CFS and 20 gauge stainless
  steel sheet for wearing surfaces. The Arc-gear is factory bolted to two 16
  gauge stiffened C-channel pivot arms at the spring line and to two ZA27
  stow-locking plates at the rack mid-point.
 
  **A-frame Assembly:** The A-frame assembly includes the Arc-gear assembly
  field installed to the A-frame with a pin through the mid-point of the pivot
  arm.
 
  **Z-purlins:** Purlins are pre-galvanized, pre-punched, 18 guage, asymetric
  cold-rolled sections that accommodate two or three A-frames per table and
  support the PV panels. 
 
  **Drive system:** The drive system is an assembly of stainless steel pinion
  gears, zinc-alloy bushings, and 16 gauge galvanized drive tubes and couplers.
  A continuous drive tube section with field installed pinions at each A-frame
  is inserted through the A-frame tie. Couplers connect the drive tubes between
  tables and accommodate grade changes.

  Tracks are structural plain concrete grade beams that provide ballast against
  over-turning and sliding and transfer loads from the A-frame to the ground
  through bearing and friction. They are slip formed and divided into one
  segment per A-frame leg with control joints . The weight of each segment is
  designed to resist sliding and uplift. Concrete material is a significant
  project cost and the track geometry is evaluated for the wind demands at each
  project site to minimize material by varying the track height. The final track
  geometry is controlled by the following factors:
 
  - minimum section weight required for uplift and sliding
  - maximum concrete tensile stress under down and uplift forces
  - maximum allowable distance between control joints controlled by shrinkage
  - geometry requirements for vehicle tracking
 
  Maximum design tensile stress must be less than ACI 318 allowable levels for
  structural plain concrete. The maximum design uplift is 1" under design wind
  loads and no slip under ASCE seismic design methods for rigid structures
  supported at grade. The maintenance vehicles traverse a track approximately
  monthly. Maximum wheel loads are 300 lbs and the maximum allowable
  differential offset across joints is 1/2 inch.
 
  Tracks are placed in continuous rows as either a strip (exterior
  tracks), or two simultaneously formed parallel footings. Control joints
  are saw cut shortly after initial set. Expansion joints are typically not
  required but may be needed in some cases where concrete drying shrinkage does
  not offset potential thermal expansion. 
 
  Concrete materials and batching are locally sourced following Alion
  concrete and slip forming specifications. Typical track mix designs follow
  local practices for sidewalk or paving mixes. Mix designs are prepared
  by local contractors that take into consideration the soil
  chemistry, slip forming process and load requirements for the project site.
  Mix design and quality control processes follow ACI and other project
  specifications.
 
  Concrete mix designs are specified to meet project requirements, including:
 
  - Durability specified in ACI 318
  - Compressive strength to satisfy imposed loads and permeability
  - Placement rates, geometry tolerances and surface quality
 
  Geotechnical studies provide minimum bearing capacities and maximum long
  term differential settlement and heave. In general, sites prepared with
  standard proof rolling requirements (1/4" maximum deflection under loaded
  truck tires) can satisfy the low bearing pressure demands of the system (about
  1 psi). Track bearing and applied loads are small so native soil stability is
  the primary consideration, not imposed structural loads.
 
  The lifespan of plain structural concrete can be as long as 80 years.  Typical
  lifespans considered by municipalities for unreinforced sidewalks and curbs is
  25 to 50 years. In practice, lifespans for curb and pavement structures can be
  shortened by tensile stresses induced by heavy wheel loads or uplift from tree
  roots. These are not load cases for the AST.
 
 
 
 
 
  Slew drives are located at the center of rows
  and at the outside quarter points of the end and transition rows.
  They are anchored to a cast-in-place, drive block with embedded or
  post installed adhesive anchors.  Peak demands on the ballast and slew drive
  anchorage are under software control.  If wind speeds reach 50 mph or
  slew drive power demands exceed expected values the row rotates to flat
  (0 degree) stow until wind speeds subside or repairs are made.

============================================================================
 
  Tables are supported by two A-frame assemblies at interior rows and three at
  exterior rows. A table is field assembled from A-frame and Arc 
  assemblies and Z-purlins. The component materials are pre-galvanized (G90), 50
  ksi, 16 or 18 gauge, steel sheet formed with stamping or rolling processes.
  The three table components are connected by field installed bolts and
  inter-locking tabs. Connections between components are generally made with
  1/4" lock bolts or high strength nuts and bolts torqued to develop a minimum
  clamping force of 1,800 lbs.
 
  Arc-gear assemblies include a large curved rack gear bolted to a stiffened
  C-channel pivot arm connected in turn to the A-frame with a pin. The gear
  wearing surface is a stamped, 20 gauge stainless steel strip. The various
  arc-gear rack components, including interlocking L-shapes and wearing strips
  are connected with factory installed rivets.
 
  Asymmetries in the components are accounted for in the analysis and design
  checks and confirmed by assembly and component load tests. Z-purlin flanges
  are asymmetric, with larger bottom flanges to compensate for longer unbraced
  lengths. Legs are braced by ties which are asymmetrically connected to leg
  flanges. Loads from Arc-gears are transferred asymmetrically to the pivot
  arms.
 
  Member capacities are calculated and evaluated by test based on the *Indian
  Standard Code of Practice for Use of Cold-Formed Light Guage Steel Structural
  Memebers in General Building Construction* and the *North
  American Specification for the Design of Cold-Formed Steel Structural
  Members*. The specifications include the effects of buckling, property
  variations and residual stresses generated by forming. Full scale tests
  confirm the calculated design capacities.

============================================================================
 
  The drive system includes the drive tubes, couplers, Arg-gear, pinion gear and
  bushing. Tubes and couplers are pre-galvanized, 16 gauge tubes with stamped
  holes and stainless steel fittings to permit grade following and allow for
  thermal expansion. The drive tube is continuous under each table. Four or five
  through bolt field connections are made in each drive tube depending on
  whether it is an interior or exterior row. A coupler is connected between drive tubes wi
th a through bolt and
  cast fitting that distributes shear stresses. A pinion gear engages the
  arc-gear at each A-frame (two or three). Pinion gears are cast stainless
  steel. Bushings and locking plates are cast or sintered Zinc Aluminum alloy
  (ZA). 
 
  The drive system is designed to rotate the tables to 0 degrees stow under
  software control when either of two conditions are met:  
 
  1. Wind speeds exceed the operation limit of 50 mph. 
  2. Slew drive power demand exceeds expected values, indicating a potential
     problem in the row.
 
  These software limits, together with power and mechanical limits on the motor
  and drive set an upper bound on the drive system and slew ballast torque
  demand.
