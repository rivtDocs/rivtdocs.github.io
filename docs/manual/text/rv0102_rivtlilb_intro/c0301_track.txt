  For this pilot project only exterior tracks will be built and they are
  analyzed in this section. Tracks (interior) are also generally discussed for
  completeness. Refer to report section [0201][4] reference [13] for analysis of
  a typical block that includes tracks and exterior tracks.
 
  Tracks are symmetric pairs of plain, slip formed concrete grade beams that
  transfer loads from the table to the ground through bearing and friction and
  provide ballast for uplift and overturning resistance. Exterior tracks are
  similar but are formed as a single section to provide the additional ballast
  needed for higher wind loads at exterior rows. The track designs provide
  ballast and tensile strength capacities that exceed design demands.

  The track design is governed by two sets of forces, one long term and one
  short term.  The long term forces are primarily axial and arise from
  shrinkage and thermal stresses.  These are controlled by mix design,
  control joints, subgrade friction and curing processes. In most cases
  shrinkage will be sufficient to offset the need for expansion joints.
  Differential settlement can also contribute to long term stresses.
 
  Short term forces include wind and seismic loads. These loads generate
  shear and bending forces in the track beam and local pull out forces at the
  feet. In general the short and long term forces do not act concurrently. As
  the tracks lift from the soil the axial forces that arise from ground friction
  restraint are reduced.
 
  Structural design of the track is also governed by the very infrequent,
  short duration uplift bending and foot pull out loads from extreme wind and
  seismic events. Track bending capacities are determined by calculation. Foot
  cone pullout capacities are determined by test and calculation.
 
  Each A-frame is associated with a track segment length of
  about 3 m, or 2 m in the case of end tables which have 3 A-frames per table.
  These segments generally act independently except in the case of edge tables.
  At edge tables, control joints are either skewed to interlock, or shear dowels
  are epoxied in the groove to provide additional uplift resistance by engaging
  the adjacent track and using wind load area averaging effects.
 
  Prior to installing the tracks, the subgrade is compacted and proof rolled
  using loaded trucks with tire pressures on the order of 700 kPa. Long term
  bearing stresses from the weight of the system are about 5 kPa which is much
  less than the foundation design capacity of 150 kPa provided in the
  geotechnical report. Because loads are small, relatively poor soils can
  provide adequate support. Short term bearing stresses from wind and seismic
  loads are less than 15 kPa.
 
  Concrete mix designs are expected to be based on IS 456 and IS 4926
  specifications and project conditions. A minimum f'c of 20 MPa will typically
  provide sufficient strength. Slip formed concrete is typically low slump but
  because control joints are widely spaced (about 10 feet) other components of
  the mix design including water-cement ratios need to be controlled to reduce
  shrinkage to the range of 0.4%. Deep control joints at least half the track
  depth are cut at locations at the mid-points between each A-frame soon after
  initial set - about 4 hours after placement. Control joint spacing is about 3
  m on center for tracks and 2 m on center for exterior tracks.
 
  Surface finish is not a major design concern but good surface strength
  in the groove is needed to provide pull out strength. After the
  joints are cut the groove is either sprayed with an epoxy adhesive compatible
  curing compound or capped with deformable backing rod to prevent drying and
  coating of the groove with wax curing compound applied to the rest of the
  track. The cap also keeps out dirt.
 
  A-frame feet are epoxy anchored in track grooves starting several days
  after the concrete has cured.  The figures below illustrate the two joint
  configurations. Epoxy properties are provided in Appendix 1.

  Long term demands include spanning over changes in support profiles
  and thermal and shrinkage stresses arising from soil friction.
  Maximum axial stresses arising from shrinkage and thermal forces are
  bounded by the product of the soil friction factor and track weight.
  The weight of one side of a track section is about 2500 N and the
  leg dead load reaction is about 500 N. Given a FF of 1 the
  apparent demand limit on internal tension forces from shrinkage
  and thermal is 3000 N, which is a small fraction of the axial capacity.
 
  Loss of subgrade support over distances up to 2 feet may be spanned
  by the track. Larger areas are repaired as part of the system maintenance.

  The design base shear for the site is 0.05 g (see [0202][5]). 
  Typical values of soil to concrete shear resistance are 0.6. The
