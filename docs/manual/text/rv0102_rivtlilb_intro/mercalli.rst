    | Mercalli   |  Effects observed                                  |
    +============+====================================================+
    | I          | Not felt except by a very few under especially     |
    |            | favorable conditions.                              |
    +------------+----------------------------------------------------+
    | II         | Felt only by a few persons at rest, especially on  |
    |            | upper floors of buildings. Delicately suspended    |
    |            | objects may swing.                                 |
    +------------+----------------------------------------------------+
    | III        | Felt quite noticeably by persons indoors,          |
    |            | especially on the upper floors of buildings. Many  |
    |            | do not recognize it as an earthquake. Standing     |
    |            | motor cars may rock slightly. Vibration similar to |
    |            | the passing of a truck. Duration estimated.        |
    +------------+----------------------------------------------------+
    | IV         | Felt indoors by many, outdoors by few during the   |
    |            | day. At night, some awakened. Dishes, windows,     |
    |            | doors disturbed; walls make cracking sound.        |
    |            | Sensation like heavy truck striking building.      |
    |            | Standing motor cars rocked noticeably.             |
    +------------+----------------------------------------------------+
    | V          | Felt by nearly everyone; many awakened. Some       |
    |            | dishes and windows broken. Unstable objects        |
    |            | overturned. Pendulum clocks may stop.              |
    +------------+----------------------------------------------------+
    | VI         | Felt by all; many frightened and run outdoors,     |
    |            | walk unsteadily. Windows, dishes, glassware        |
    |            | broken, books off shelves, some heavy furniture    |
    |            | moved or overturned; a few instances of fallen     |
    |            | plaster. Damage slight.                            |
    +------------+----------------------------------------------------+
    | VII        | Difficult to stand. Furniture broken. Damage       |
    |            | negligible in building of good design and          |
    |            | construction; slight to moderate in well-built     |
    |            | ordinary structures; considerable damage in poorly |
    |            | built or badly designed structures; some chimneys  |
    |            | broken. Noticed by persons driving motor cars.     |
    +------------+----------------------------------------------------+
    | VIII       | Damage slight in specially designed structures;    |
    |            | considerable in ordinary substantial buildings     |
    |            | with partial collapse. Damage great in poorly      |
    |            | built structures. Fall of chimneys, factory        |
    |            | stacks, columns, monuments, walls. Heavy furniture |
    |            | moved.                                             |
    +------------+----------------------------------------------------+
    | IX         | General panic... Damage considerable in specially  |
    |            | designed structures, well designed frame           |
    |            | structures thrown out of plumb. Damage great even  |
    |            | in substantial buildings, with partial collapse.   |
    |            | Buildings shifted off foundations.                 |
    +------------+----------------------------------------------------+
    | X          | Some well built wooden structures destroyed; most  |
    |            | masonry and frame structures destroyed with        |

    | XII        | Damage total. Lines of sight and level distorted.  |
